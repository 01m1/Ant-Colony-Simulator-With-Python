# Ant Colony Simulator üêú
Explore the behaviour of ants in this interactive simulator. This project leverages Python, utilising Pygame and NumPy to simulate realistic ant behaviour.

# Getting Started

Upon launching the program, you'll encounter a user-friendly menu where you can adjust simulation settings and start the simulation.

**Simulation Features**

* **Ant Behavior:** Ants wander around randomly across the screen in search of food. Once they collect food, they transport it back to their home.

* **Pheromone Trails:** Ants lay down pheromone trails to guide others to food sources. Paths strengthen over time as more ants use them, with shorter paths initially stronger.

* **Pheromone Dynamics:** Pheromones evaporate gradually, adjusting path strengths dynamically based on recent activity. This results in ants discovering the shortest path to a food source.

* **Queen Ant Mechanics:** The queen ant, identified by its yellow head and blue circle, can fly over walls. It spawns a new ant every 50 food items collected, contributing to colony growth.

**Settings**

Navigate to the settings menu to customise the simulator. Import and export settings using the buttons at the top-right corner. Settings configurations are saved locally as text files for future use.

Start the simulation by clicking the 'Start' button on the main menu. Observe ants as they navigate the simulated environment.

* **Left Click:** Place food items
* **Right Click:** Remove food items or create walls
* **Middle Click:** Build walls

# Installation

Python can be installed from the official python website.

You can clone the repository and setup a virtual environment and install all the necessary libraries automatically by running `install.sh` (for Linux).

OR

You can install NumPy and PyGame yourself through the following command in your terminal.

`pip install numpy pygame`

Clone the repository and execute main.py with python3 to begin.

`python3 main.py`
